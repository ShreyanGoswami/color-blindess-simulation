        "text": ["In this tutorial we will learn an application of color space and that is, how to simulate color blindness. Color blindness is a hereditary condition, more common in males than females. Around 1 in 12 males are affected by color blindness while 1 in 200 females are affected by color blindness. The reason more males are impacted is because color blindness occurs when there is a defect in the X chromosome. Since males have one X chromosome compared to two in females, males are more susceptible to this condition.",
            "Simulating color blindness is an interesting application of using the color space in an innovative way as we will see in the tutorial. The main reason such a simulation is possible is due to the linearity of color space. Hence, colors can be added and transformed just like a vector space."]

        "text": ["To answer this question we need a brief introduction to the human visual system. Our eyes contain cones and rods for detecting color around them. The rods are used at night or in a dark environment. The cones are the main structure that allows us to perceive color. There are three types of cones called large, medium and small cones. Each cone is good at handling a particular range of wavelengths. You can see the response function for each cone. The y-axis on the graph is the probability that the cone will be activated for that particular wavelength. As you can see the three cone responses overlap i.e more than one cone can get activated at a particular wavelength.",
            "The response of the cones to a light spectrum is called the LMS response. Light normally features a wide range of wavelengths as demonstrated by Issac Newton. Our eye creates a single LMS response for an entire light spectrum effectively integrating the energies of light at each wavelength.",
            "There are many misconceptions about color blindness and one of the main ones is the view that color blind people canâ€™t see any color at all. That is not correct. Depending on the type of color blindness, a color blind person will not see particular colors in the spectrum."]

        "text": ["The types of color blindness can be specified by first knowing how many different types of cones are not working for an individual. A person who has all three types of cones working normally is referred to as a trichromat. A person who has two types of cones working is referred to as a dichromat. Finally, the most rare of them all is a monochromat who has one type of cone working. A dichromat is further classified into Protanopia, who has a defective L cone, Deuteranopia,  who has a defective M cone, Tritanopia, who has a defective S cone.",
            "Most common are the dichromats, who have a weak/missing cone. Out of that red-green is the most common. As we will see later, by choosing the correct invariant color we can simulate any type of dichromatic vision"]

            "To perform the simulation, the paper described deriving two two-dimensional planes. The idea relies on previous studies done on an unilateral color deficient observer. An unilateral color deficient person is color blind in one eye while being trichromat in the other. With their help the study showed that at wavelengths 475nm and 575nm a trichromat and dichromat perceive the color in the same way. Also neutral white is perceived in the same way by a dichromat and trichromat.<Add references>",

Apart from the ability to perceive color the human eye is capable of adapting to the scene. White is always perceived as white regardless of the lighting conditions in the scene. We are going to assume that a color blind person does not lose this ability of adaptation",

One of the common problems with such a deficiency is the difficulty to pick ripe fruits in particular apples. Sometimes a Protanope would have trouble distinguishing traffic signals when they are in a different country as the order in which the signals are arranged can be different.",
